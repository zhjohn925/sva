- Immediate assertions are simple non-temporal domain assertions 
  that are executed like statements in a procedural block. 
  
- Interpret them as an expression in the condition of a procedural ‘if’ statement. 
  
- Immediate assertions can be specified only where a procedural statement 
  is specified.
  
- This assertion can be preceded by a level sensitive or an edge sensitive statement.
  (The concurrent assertions can work only off of a sampling "edge" and not off of 
   a level sensitive control.)
  
Example:

  always @(posedge clk) 
  begin
    if (a) begin
      @(posedge d);
      bORc: 
         //'%m' prints [module_name].bORc 
         assert (b || c) $display("\n", $stime,,,"%m assert passed\n");
         else  //This 'else' is for the 'assert'. not for the 'if (a)'
            $fatal("\n", $stime,,,"%m assert failed \n");
    end
  end
